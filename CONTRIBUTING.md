## Features and Bugs

Before you start working on a change, visit the
[issues](https://github.com/cterrazas2/pyvet/issues) and
[pull-requests](https://github.com/cterrazas2/pyvet/pulls) tabs and see if there
is something already related to your change. If not, then once your change is
completed locally, ideally in your own branch, ensure all tests pass (and add
tests to your change), and then create a pull request filled out with all the
pertinent information.
